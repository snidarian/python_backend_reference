#Start the redis server with the command "redis-server". The command should contain as its first argument an absolute path to a redis.conf configuration file

redis-server /home/user/example_configuration_file.conf

# Now you can interact with the redis instance at 127.0.0.1 on port 6379 by default


$ redis-cli ping
PONG


# You use the redis-cli command without any argument to enter an interactive mode or simply use the redis-cli command with the proper arguments to get and set key-value pairs. For instance:


# Set a key value pair
$ redis-cli set some_key some_value



# get a key value pair
$ redis-cli get some_key
"somevalue"



# Shell scripts too can make use of redis databases.
# In this directory there's a shell script that illustrates bash interaction with a redis database
